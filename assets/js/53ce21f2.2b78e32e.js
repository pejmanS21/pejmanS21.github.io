According to their website, Ansible \u201cprovides a simple, yet powerful, automation engine for tackling complex workflows and orchestrating seamless deployments.\u201d\nThe key advantage of Ansible is that it allows for automation without the need for special coding skills. With its simple YAML syntax, you can automate everything from deployment to configuration management to continuous delivery.\nOne important concept to understand when working with Ansible is that it uses a declarative approach to configuration management. This means that instead of specifying step-by-step instructions for tasks, you declare the state that you want your infrastructure to be in, and Ansible will take care of the details for you.\nAnsible also uses a client-server architecture. The Ansible server (also known as the control machine) communicates with one or more Ansible clients (also known as managed nodes) to execute tasks. However, unlike other configuration management tools, Ansible does not require an agent to be installed on the client machines. Instead, it relies on SSH or WinRM protocols to establish a connection.\nGetting Started with Ansible\nTo get started using Ansible, you\u2019ll need to install it on your control machine. Ansible supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. Once you have Ansible installed, you can use it to execute tasks on one or more managed nodes.\nA critical part of Ansible is understanding the inventory. The inventory is a file that specifies the managed nodes and groups of nodes that Ansible will target. The inventory can be a static file or generated dynamically from sources such as cloud providers, LDAP, or DNS.\nOne of the great features of Ansible is that it offers a large collection of pre-written tasks and modules called \u201cAnsible Galaxy.\u201d These modules can be easily installed and used in your playbook. Additionally, Ansible provides a powerful templating system (Jinja2) that allows you to personalize your task execution."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"advanced-ansible-techniques"},"Advanced Ansible Techniques"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"As you become more familiar with Ansible, you can start to take advantage of its more advanced features.
